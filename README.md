# F1 Data Visualization Analysis on Grid Positions

This is a Data Analysis and Data Visualization project built with <a href="https://plotly.com/dash/">plotly dash</a>. The data was extracted from the <a href="http://ergast.com/mrd/">ergast</a>, which is a great source to pull historical race data from F1. You can find how the data was pulled and processed in the Jupyter notebook file. For the dashboard code, you can view the `main.py` file. For the analysis and explanation, you can find more information in my <a href="https://deegoanalytics.herokuapp.com/blog/Analyzing-the-Importance-of-Grid-Positions-in-Formula-1">blog post</a>. The live dashboard is hosted on Heroku, which you can find <a href="https://f1gridviz.herokuapp.com/">here</a>. Note that the dash may take a few moments to load as the workers remain asleep if there is inactivity.
